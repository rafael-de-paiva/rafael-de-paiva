## 📚 About Me

I'm currently studying **Computer Engineering**, with a strong focus on **Software Quality Assurance (QA)**. I have hands-on experience with both manual and automated testing for Web, API, Mobile and Performance, applying agile practices (Scrum, Kanban) and QA fundamentals across academic and real-world volunteer projects.

I use tools like Cypress, Selenium, Playwright, Appium, JMeter, Postman, and GitHub Actions, and I’m skilled in JavaScript, Python, Java, SQL and Bash. I'm driven by curiosity, strategy, and a genuine passion for delivering clean, reliable, and high-quality software.

One of my proudest achievements is earning the **ISTQB CTFL Certification**, which reinforced my foundation in QA principles and best practices.
