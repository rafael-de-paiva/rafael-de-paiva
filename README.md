## 📚 About Me

I'm currently pursuing a degree in **Computer Engineering** and beginning my journey in **Software Quality Assurance (QA)**. My background includes experience with computer maintenance, networks, cybersecurity, and interface design.

I'm deeply passionate about testing and quality processes, with hands-on experience in:
- **Manual testing** (Web, API via Postman & Insomnia)
- **Automated testing** for Web, API and Mobile using Cypress, CodeceptJS, Playwright, Supertest, Appium, and RestAssured
- **Test documentation** and behavior-driven development using Gherkin and Cucumber

I strive to deliver more than what's expected, constantly seeking new knowledge and learning with purpose. Sometimes I get lost thinking about how vast the world is and how little time we have to learn everything. Still, I keep pushing forward with the drive to understand as much as possible.
